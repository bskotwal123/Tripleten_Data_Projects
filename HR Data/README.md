# Hiring Trends and Costs Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing hiring trends and costs across different regions and time periods using real-world datasets. The goal is to uncover region-wise hiring patterns, evaluate hiring modes, assess relocation expenses, and analyze employee distribution to provide actionable insights for improving hiring strategies and operational efficiency.

## Datasets
1. Hiring Data
Hiring Data after2023.xls
Hiring Data before2023.xls

2. Store Data
Four .xls files divided region-wise stored in a folder.



By integrating and visualizing this data in Power BI, we aim to:

- Identify region-wise hiring trends and costs.
- Analyze hiring modes, relocation expenses, and cost efficiency.
- Evaluate employee distribution across regions and roles.
- Provide actionable insights for optimizing hiring processes and resource allocation.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following key datasets and components:

1. **Hiring Data**: Pre- and post-2023 hiring information, including new hires, costs, and hiring modes.
2. **Regional Store Data**: Regional details related to stores and hiring.
3. **Employee Data**: Information on employees, including roles, departments, and locations.

The project uses **Power BI** for data analysis and visualization, and it provides interactive dashboards to explore the data in depth.
